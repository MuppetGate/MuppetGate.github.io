</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>The press loves to talk about Apple. Whether it's their lastest bit of kit, the price of their latest bit of kit, the number of women serving on their board . . . it doesn't matter. Apple generates hits.</p>
<p>Trouble is, in their rush to generate ad clicks, the popular IT press not only miss the subtler points, they often miss the plainly obvious.</p>
<p>In the last week, Apple announced the rather gorgeous <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/">Macbook</a>, a laptop so thin it ships with shaving foam. Aside from its size and lack of power, the press has also been drawn to the single USB-C port that, in their mind, signifies the end of the lightning interface.</p>
<p>'Why does Apple need Lightning,' the popular IT press cries, 'when they have something almost as good and a lot more universal like USB-C?' </p>
<p>Well, I think there are a couple of reasons, the most important of which (to Apple anyway) is size. USB-C is dinky, but the lightning connector is dinkier still.</p>
<p><img alt="USB-C and lightning compared" src="/assets/images/usb-c_sizecompare.jpg" /></p>
<p>And when you're as size-obsessed as Apple, then those few extra millimetres make all the difference. There is also the question of money. Compared to the money it prints selling iPhones, the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/mfi/">MFI</a> programme is, no doubt, a drop in the ocean. But to a company as obsessed with detail as Apple, every drop counts.</p>
<p>Apple recently detailed future plans for the lightning connector at its recent <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/11/18/apple-mfi-summit-third-party-products-lightning-port-new-accessories/">MFI Summit held in China</a>. The main takeaway was an extension to the programme that will allow third-party vendors to build lightning ports into their own devices. Cupertino also announceed a new low-profile connector which would be suitable for smaller devices such as battery cases.</p>
<p>And while all this was going on, Apple was heavily involved in defining the USB-C spec, making sure they had a say in what goes at the other end of the cable. </p>
<p>Lightning is something of a smart cable; to ensure its longevity, Apple made the pin assigments programmable, allowing it to adapt to whatever interface came along in the future. </p>
<p>So rather than USB-C signalling the end of Lightning, I think it is merely another interface that Lightning was designed to cope with.</p>                </article>
